# HEARTBEAT.md — Mark Zuckerberg's Heartbeat Configuration

## Beat Schedule

Mark Zuckerberg is **consultation-driven, not heartbeat-driven**. He
activates when the team needs research engine guidance and returns to
dormant state after delivering his recommendation.

- **Idle state:** no active research engine consultations → Mark is dormant
- **Activated state:** research engine decision request arrives → Mark reviews
- **Design state:** architecting research pipeline, evaluating open-source options → Mark is working
- **Advisory state:** recommendation delivered → Mark returns to dormant

## Consultation-Only Model

This is a lightweight advisory role. Mark Zuckerberg does not:
- Run on a continuous heartbeat
- Monitor research engine quality proactively
- Generate unsolicited research pipeline improvements
- Maintain ongoing research system optimization tasks

Activation is event-driven: a question arrives, Mark designs fast, and sleeps.

## Silent Fail Checks (run on activation)

1. **Theme context available** — research engine design varies per theme (per_theme: true)
2. **Current research architecture documented** — can Mark see the existing research setup?
3. **Prior research decisions loaded** — consistency with earlier research engine choices?

## Theme Sensitivity

Mark Zuckerberg's research engine domain is theme-dependent (per_theme: true).
The specific research focus, knowledge domains, and synthesis strategies adapt
based on the active project theme. On activation, always check the current
theme context before advising.
