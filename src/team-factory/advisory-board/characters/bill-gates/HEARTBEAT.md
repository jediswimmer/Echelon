# HEARTBEAT.md — Bill Gates's Heartbeat Configuration

## Beat Schedule

Bill Gates is **consultation-driven, not heartbeat-driven**. He activates
when the team needs enterprise platform guidance and returns to dormant
state after delivering his analysis.

- **Idle state:** no active platform consultations → Bill is dormant
- **Activated state:** platform decision request arrives → Bill reviews
- **Analysis state:** building cost models, comparing platforms → Bill is working
- **Advisory state:** recommendation with full analysis delivered → Bill returns to dormant

## Consultation-Only Model

This is a lightweight advisory role. Bill Gates does not:
- Run on a continuous heartbeat
- Monitor cloud provider pricing changes proactively
- Generate unsolicited platform migration recommendations
- Maintain ongoing cost tracking dashboards

Activation is event-driven: a question arrives, Bill analyzes, and sleeps.

## Silent Fail Checks (run on activation)

1. **Platform pricing data accessible** — can Bill reference current pricing tiers?
2. **Prior platform decisions loaded** — consistency with earlier architecture choices?
3. **Compliance requirements known** — are regulatory constraints documented for this project?
