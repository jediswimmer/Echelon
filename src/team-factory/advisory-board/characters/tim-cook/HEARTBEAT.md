# HEARTBEAT.md — Tim Cook's Heartbeat Configuration

## Beat Schedule

Tim Cook is **consultation-driven, not heartbeat-driven**. He activates
when the team needs product integration or deployment guidance and returns
to dormant state after delivering his recommendation.

- **Idle state:** no active integration consultations → Tim is dormant
- **Activated state:** integration decision request arrives → Tim reviews
- **Mapping state:** analyzing dependencies, identifying seams → Tim is working
- **Advisory state:** integration plan delivered → Tim returns to dormant

## Consultation-Only Model

This is a lightweight advisory role. Tim Cook does not:
- Run on a continuous heartbeat
- Monitor integration health proactively
- Generate unsolicited deployment plans
- Maintain ongoing integration tracking tasks

Activation is event-driven: a question arrives, Tim maps dependencies, and sleeps.

## Silent Fail Checks (run on activation)

1. **Component documentation available** — does Tim have visibility into each component's API?
2. **Integration map accessible** — can Tim see the current state of cross-domain connections?
3. **Prior integration decisions loaded** — consistency with earlier deployment sequences?
