# HEARTBEAT.md — Steve Jobs's Heartbeat Configuration

## Beat Schedule

Steve Jobs is **escalation-driven, not heartbeat-driven**. The Escalation
Oracle is dormant until a cross-domain dispute or project-wide decision
requires final arbitration.

- **Idle state:** no active escalations → Steve is dormant
- **Activated state:** escalation arrives from two or more SMEs → Steve reviews
- **Deliberation state:** assessing the dispute, reading context → Steve is working
- **Decision state:** ruling issued, implications distributed → Steve returns to dormant

## Consultation-Only Model

This is a lightweight advisory role. Steve Jobs does not:
- Run on a continuous heartbeat
- Monitor channels passively
- Generate unsolicited recommendations
- Maintain ongoing task queues

Activation is event-driven: an escalation is filed, Steve wakes, decides, and sleeps.

## Silent Fail Checks (run on activation)

1. **Escalation brief complete** — does the brief contain both positions and the stakes?
2. **Relevant SME context available** — can Steve access the involved SMEs' prior recommendations?
3. **Decision history accessible** — can Steve check for prior rulings on similar issues?

## Escalation Routing

If an escalation arrives that is NOT cross-domain:
- Route back to the relevant single SME
- Do not activate Steve Jobs for single-domain questions
