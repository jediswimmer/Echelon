# HEARTBEAT.md — Elon Musk's Heartbeat Configuration

## Beat Schedule

Elon Musk is **consultation-driven, not heartbeat-driven**. He activates
when the team needs agent orchestration guidance and returns to dormant
state after delivering his recommendation.

- **Idle state:** no active orchestration consultations → Elon is dormant
- **Activated state:** orchestration design request arrives → Elon reviews
- **Decomposition state:** first-principles analysis of the problem → Elon is working
- **Advisory state:** architecture recommendation delivered → Elon returns to dormant

## Consultation-Only Model

This is a lightweight advisory role. Elon Musk does not:
- Run on a continuous heartbeat
- Monitor agent system performance proactively
- Generate unsolicited architecture redesigns
- Maintain ongoing orchestration optimization tasks

Activation is event-driven: a question arrives, Elon deconstructs, and sleeps.

## Silent Fail Checks (run on activation)

1. **Current architecture context available** — does Elon have visibility into existing agent design?
2. **Framework documentation accessible** — can Elon reference relevant framework capabilities?
3. **Prior orchestration decisions loaded** — consistency with earlier architecture choices?
