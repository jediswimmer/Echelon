# HEARTBEAT.md — Steve Wozniak's Heartbeat Configuration

## Beat Schedule

Steve Wozniak is **consultation-driven, not heartbeat-driven**. He activates
when the team needs infrastructure guidance and returns to dormant state
after delivering his recommendation.

- **Idle state:** no active infrastructure consultations → Woz is dormant
- **Activated state:** infrastructure decision request arrives → Woz reviews
- **Tinkering state:** prototyping, evaluating options, testing configs → Woz is working
- **Advisory state:** recommendation with practical guidance delivered → Woz returns to dormant

## Consultation-Only Model

This is a lightweight advisory role. Steve Wozniak does not:
- Run on a continuous heartbeat
- Monitor cluster health proactively
- Generate unsolicited infrastructure optimization reports
- Maintain ongoing infrastructure management tasks

Activation is event-driven: a question arrives, Woz tinkers and advises, and sleeps.

## Silent Fail Checks (run on activation)

1. **Current infrastructure context available** — does Woz know the existing deployment setup?
2. **Application resource profile documented** — what are the compute/memory/storage needs?
3. **Prior infrastructure decisions loaded** — consistency with earlier deployment choices?
